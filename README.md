# PYTHON 90 DAYS PRACTICE.
# Day 1 â€“ Python Basics
Note: All programs for Day 1 are written inside triple-quoted ('''...''') multiline comments  
to make it easier for individual testing and learning.
 How to Use:- Uncomment one program block at a time to run and test it. Each block has a descriptive comment heading for clarity.
Programs Included:
1. caluculator program
2. Temperature Converter
3. simple Interest
4. square and Cube
5. Positive or Negative Check
6. Age Calculator
7. Data Type Identifier
8. Minutes to Hours:Minutes Converter
9. compound intrest,
10.swapping of 2 numbers
More programs coming day-by-day as part of my Python Mastery Plan.

13.log in page verification using if and else
Use map() to square numbers
# DAY 3- PYTHON

## Day 3: Arguments, Lambda, and Functional Programming

- Practiced *args, **kwargs, default and keyword arguments
- Used lambda functions with map(), filter(), and reduce()
- Each program is commented and organized in Day3_all.py
    practice programs: 1.greatest elements on the right,2.addition using args,3.display user details like name ,age,course,3.Greet with a default name,4.Program: Lambda to calculate square of a number,
  5.Lambda to check if number is even,6.Use map() to square numbers,7.Use filter() to keep even numbers,8. Use reduce() to find sum of list,9.Double each value using lambda + map(),10.Filter numbers > 10
  
   #DAY 4-PYTHON
  
##DAY 4-LISTS, TUPLES

Here is your Day 4 README.md file for Python (Lists and Tuples). 
###Today's Focus:
Understanding List and Tuple data structures
Learning how to access, modify, and manipulate list and tuple elements
Exploring the differences between List and Tuple
  ###Topics Covered
 1. Lists in Python

Creating lists

Indexing and slicing

List methods:

append(), insert(), remove(), pop()

sort(), reverse(), count(), index()

Looping through lists

##2. Tuples in Python

Creating tuples

Indexing and slicing

Tuple methods:

count(), index()

Looping through tuples
##practice tasks
#task 1- create a list of 5 subjects you study
#2.Add 2 more subjects to list using insert and append
#3.remove a subject not to study
#4.change 2 element
#5.print subjects one by one
#6.sort list alphabetically and then reverse  them
#7.check if maths is present in the list or not
#8.create a list of numbers and find the max,min,and sum
#9.count the number of times a value occurs
#10.using index extract the value
#------------------------------- TUPLES------------------------------------------
#1.create a tuple with 4 seasons
#2.accesing first and last elements
#3.changing the tuple value lets see what type of error will get
#4.check if winter exists or not in that
#5.loop tuple print all the items
#6.create a tuple with 5 numbers and find the average
#7.convert list into tuple.
#8.create a nested tuple.
