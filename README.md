# PYTHON 90 DAYS PRACTICE.
# Day 1 â€“ Python Basics
Note: All programs for Day 1 are written inside triple-quoted ('''...''') multiline comments  
to make it easier for individual testing and learning.
 How to Use:- Uncomment one program block at a time to run and test it. Each block has a descriptive comment heading for clarity.
Programs Included:
1. caluculator program
2. Temperature Converter
3. simple Interest
4. square and Cube
5. Positive or Negative Check
6. Age Calculator
7. Data Type Identifier
8. Minutes to Hours:Minutes Converter
9. compound intrest,
10.swapping of 2 numbers
More programs coming day-by-day as part of my Python Mastery Plan.

**#DAY2 PYTHON**
**OPERATORS,CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS,LOOPS,FUNCTIONS**

Use map() to square numbers
# DAY 3- PYTHON
## Day 3: Arguments, Lambda, and Functional Programming
- Practiced *args, **kwargs, default and keyword arguments
- Used lambda functions with map(), filter(), and reduce()
- Each program is commented and organized in Day3_all.py
    practice programs: 1.greatest elements on the right,2.addition using args,3.display user details like name ,age,course,3.Greet with a default name,4.Program: Lambda to calculate square of a number,
  5.Lambda to check if number is even,6.Use map() to square numbers,7.Use filter() to keep even numbers,8. Use reduce() to find sum of list,9.Double each value using lambda + map(),10.Filter numbers > 10
